/*
    SCOPE
        - scope is how a computer keeps track of all of the variables we create in our code
        - whenever we open up {}, we create a new scope (local scope). Any variables that we create that are locally scoped, are only available in that local scope - so not available globally
        - globally scoped variables are accessible anywhere in our document
*/

function scope(){
    let x= 33;
    console.log(x); //33
}

scope(); //calling the function by it's name, followed by parens, 'invokes', or calls the function- telling it to run
console.log(x); //12

/*
    VAR vs LEFT
        - while var and let seem to operate the same - they have a lot of the same functionality (both allow us to declare and initialize variable) - they also behave differently from one another
         - var is scoped to the nearest function block {}, and let is scoped to the nearest enclosing block {}
