/*
    FOR OF LOOPS
        - where for in loops look at enumerable, or countable properties - for of loops look at iterable properties
            - iterable properties are properties that we can parse through with numbers, or indices

        - for in loops: better suited for objects
        - for of loops: better suited for arrays
